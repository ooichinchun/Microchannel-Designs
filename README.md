## Microchannel-Designs

Workflow and Scripts for Running Simulations of 2D Microchannels with Heat and Mass Transfer

____

This is a repo of scripts to:
1) [Generate multiple 2D microchannel designs based on Bezier curve parameterizations](./CreateDesigns/Readme.md) 
2) [Set-up input files and scripts to batch run the numerical simulations with an in-house solver developed by P.H. Chiu](./SimulateDesigns/Readme.md) 
3) [Post-process outputs to aggregate and prepare simulations for downstream applications](./ProcessDesigns/Readme.md) 

Scripts and instructions for the various steps are provided in the accompanying subsections.

Note 1: This is not an official IHPC product, but please credit this work if this is helpful to you.

Note 2: Python scripts are written for Python version 3.8
