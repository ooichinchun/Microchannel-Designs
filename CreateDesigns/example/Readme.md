## Examples of the outputs from the pipe generation and simulation process

These files are generated during pipe generation:
1) ls_XXXXX.png
2) vof_XXXXX.png
3) input_XXXXX.dat
4) pipes_XXXXX.p
5) run_XXXXX.inp

These files are generated from the numerical simulation:
1) mon_XXXXX.inp
2) output_XXXXX.dat
